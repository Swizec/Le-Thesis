Four letter word just to get me along
It's a difficulty and I'm biting on my tongue and uh
I keep stalling, and keeping me together
People around gotta find something to say now

Holding back, everyday the same
Don't wanna be a loner
Listen to me, oh no, I never say anything at all
But with nothing to consider they forget my name, ame, ame

They call me girl
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane

That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name

They call me quiet girl
But I'm a riot yeah
Maybe Joleisa
Always the same

That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name

I miss the catch if they throw me the ball
I'm the last kid standing up against the wall
Keep up, falling, these heels they keep me boring
Getting glammed up and sitting on the fence now

So alone all the time at night
Lock myself away, listen to me, I'm not
Although I'm dressed up, out and all with
Everything considered they forget my name, ame, ame

They call me girl
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane

That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name

They call me quiet girl
But I'm a riot yeah
Maybe Joleisa
Always the same

That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name

Are you calling me darling?
Are you calling me bird?
They call me girl
(Are you calling me darling?)
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane

That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name

They call me quiet girl
(Are you calling me bird?)
But I'm a riot yeah
Maybe Joleisa
Always the same

That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
