{"name":"Le-thesis","body":"# Le Thesis\r\n\r\nThis is my graduation thesis, feel free to poke around and tell\r\nme what an idiot I am.\r\n\r\nIt comes out of a project I slowly started working on a while ago: https://github.com/Swizec/Generative-poetry\r\n\r\n\r\nSome recaps of general research in this field are on my blog:\r\n\r\n* Towards a computational model of poetry generation: http://swizec.com/blog/science-wednesday-towards-a-computational-model-of-poetry-generation/swizec/3855\r\n* Defining poetry: http://swizec.com/blog/science-wednesday-defining-poetry/swizec/4079\r\n\r\n\r\n# Le Goals\r\n\r\nTo implement a system that, given a corpora of poetry, can learn how\r\nto write its own poetry on par so that a layman observer cannot\r\ndistinguish a generated poem from one written by a poet.\r\n\r\n## Learning\r\n\r\nParameters to be learned:\r\n\r\n* rhyming structure (phonetic match of last syllables in verse)\r\n* assonance structure (vowel repetition for internal rhyming)\r\n* alliteration structure (consonant repetition)\r\n* rhythm\r\n* verse structure\r\n* stanza structure\r\n\r\nMost of this basically requires a way to syllabify text, which I\r\nbelieve can be achieved by finding a good substring cover of the\r\ncorpora with strings adhering to the C\\*V+C\\* pattern.\r\n\r\nSemantically the system needs to\r\n\r\n* sentence structure - supposedly well achievable with lexicalized\r\n  probabilistic context free grammars\r\n* semantic structure (at least for internal consistency)\r\n* sentiment (emotional infliction of the poems)\r\n\r\n## Generating\r\n\r\nThe above parameters of a poem should be constructed into some sort of\r\nDNA from which poems can then be generated. It is important to achieve\r\n\r\n* correct rhyming/assonance/alliteration or combination of these\r\n* consistent use of rhythm\r\n* appropriate division into verses and stanzas\r\n* correct sentence structure\r\n* internal semantic consistency\r\n\r\n## Measuring success\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't be too difficult to measure correctness in terms of\r\nproper rhyming etc. as long as we stick to strict poetic structures.\r\n\r\nBut this looks like an arduous manual process, so a better solution\r\nneeds to be found.\r\n","tagline":"My graduation thesis thing","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
